Additionally you should note the code is also the work and property of AxleGeaser and parts of it may be additionally licensed in even looser ways, stored elsewhere and either documented or not. Parts of it (but expressed in different coding language) date back public domain work submitted as assignments at uni, and don't belong to any of several employers who had specific instantiations of it since. This is derivative work and lessons learned here will be back migrated no the body of knowledge. Additions and pull requests ought to note that they will be contributing to that body of work/expertise; Not just adding to this repository. Any 'push' requests needing looser or no license, favorably considered. This is the low level statically 'grease' that makes the code go round.
If you are however doing an assignment for uni. Write your own damn code its good for you, copy pasta will make you fat.
